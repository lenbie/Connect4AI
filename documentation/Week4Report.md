# Week 4 Report

- made sure connect 4 can be properly reognized, changed Game class accordingly
- game can now be played, playing again added
- made a new heuristic function, still very simple, not ideal yet
- started writing unit tests to check the next move generation works as desired (incl minimax)
- first move as player 1 is column 2 not 3 as it should be - unsure why, need to improve heuristic / algo
- increasing win / loss costs made it prevent losing moves too
- added docstring comments
- started writing unit tests to check the next move generation works as desired (incl minimax)
