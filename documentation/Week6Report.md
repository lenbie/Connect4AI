- game move count implemented as suggested on labtool
- if col full, it doestn ask u to put again - fixed 

- fix winning in minimax, potentially rewrite connect 4 checker
- UI?
- it deepening and caching fs
- player number of winner (connected to check connect 4 win)

I think i call minimax in the wrong order bc AI already makes a move so we gotta call min first?!
